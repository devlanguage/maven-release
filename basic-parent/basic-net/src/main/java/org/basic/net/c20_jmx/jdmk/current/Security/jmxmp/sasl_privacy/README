#
#  Example of a secure JMXMP connector.
#
#  This example uses:
#
#  - the SASL/DIGEST-MD5 profile for user authentication and encryption,
#  - the file access controller based on the MBeanServerForwarder interface
#    for user access level authorization.
#
# ==============================================================================
#
# In order to compile & run the example, make a copy of this
# README file, update the variables to match your local installation,
# and then simply cut & paste all variable definitions & commands 
# as needed into a terminal window.
#
# Note that this README makes the assumption that you are running
# UNIX, you are familiar with the the JMX Remote API specification (in
# particular JMXServiceURL), and with Bourne or Korn shell syntax.
#
# All variable assignments and commands below are defined using 
# UNIX Korn shell syntax.
#
# If you're not running UNIX and the Korn shell you are expected
# to be able to adapt these commands to your favorite OS/shell
# environment.
#

# Update the following variables to match your local installation:
#
JDMK_HOME=@INSTALL_HOME_FOR_JDMK@
JDMK_LIB=${JDMK_HOME}/lib

classp=${JDMK_LIB}/jmx.jar:${JDMK_LIB}/jmxremote.jar:
${JDMK_LIB}/jmxremote_optional.jar:${JDMK_LIB}/sasl.jar:${JDMK_LIB}/sunsasl.jar

# JMX, JMX Remote API (mandatory) and SASL are integrated into J2SE 1.5 so
#
# classp=${JDMK_LIB}/jmxremote_optional.jar

# Compile Java classes
#
# * Server.java: creates an MBeanServer and creates and starts a secure
#                JMXMP connector server listening on port 5555.
#
# * Client.java: creates a secure JMXMP connector, creates and registers
#                a Simple standard MBean and performs operations on it.
#
# * ClientListener.java: implements a generic notification listener.
#
# * SimpleStandard.java: implements the Simple standard MBean.
#
# * SimpleStandardMBean.java: the management interface exposed by the Simple
#                             standard MBean.
#
# * DigestMD5ClientCallbackHandler.java: callback handler used by the client
#                                        to retrieve the user credentials and
#                                        supply them to the DIGEST-MD5 SASL
#                                        client mechanism.
#
# * DigestMD5ServerCallbackHandler.java: callback handler used by the server
#                                        to retrieve the user credentials stored
#                                        locally in a properties file and supply
#                                        them to the DIGEST-MD5 SASL server
#                                        mechanism which in turn compares them
#                                        with the user credentials supplied
#                                        remotely.
