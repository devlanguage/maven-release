                         Notification Example
                         ====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to use the JMX notifications on the agent side.

In particular, it shows:

        - how to listen for notifications emitted by the MBean server
        - how to emit and listen for attribute change notifications


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * Agent.java:

        - Creates an MBean server.
        - Registers an HTML adaptor with port 8082.
        - Registers an MBean server delegate listener.
        - Registers a Simple Standard MBean and registers a
          listener for the notifications emitted by this MBean.

 * AgentListener.java

        - Receives the notifications emitted by the MBean server delegate.

 * SimpleStandard.java

        - An MBean which emits attribute change notifications.

 * SimpleStandardMBean.java

        - The management interface of the SimpleStandard MBean.

 * SimpleStandardListener.java:

        - Receives the notifications emitted by the SimpleStandard MBean.

3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar) and the Java DMK runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current
directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the jar files for the Java DMK
runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the agent, type:

    java Agent

This Java DMK agent is now running on your machine. To manage the agent through
a Web browser, load the following URL: http://localhost:8082/

You may also access this agent from any remote machine on the same network by
connecting to this URL: http://<agentHostName>:8082/ (where <agentHostName> is
the name or IP address of the machine where you launched the agent).

Please refer to the tutorial provided in this software bundle for further
instructions about interacting with the Java DMK agent through the HTML
protocol adaptor.
