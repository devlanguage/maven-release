                         Relation Service Example
                         ========================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to use the Relation Service:

 - to handle relation types, that is, metadata describing the roles that a
   relation of that type has to support:

    . Creation, either of simple relation types through the Relation Service,
      or of relation types created by the user and added into the Relation
      Service
    . Access
    . Deletion

 - to handle relations, that is, links between MBeans

    . Creation, either of relations not handled as MBeans and kept internally
      in the Relation Service, or relation MBeans,
    . Access through the Relation Service to any relation, or direct access
      to relation MBeans
    . Removal

 - to perform queries to retrieve relations referencing a given MBean, or
   MBeans associated with a given MBean.

It also demonstrates the way the Relation Service maintains consistency
when MBeans referenced in relations are unregistered from the MBean server.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses the following source files:

 * RelationAgent.java:

    - Creates an MBean server
    - Registers a Relation Service MBean in the MBean server
    - Registers some standard MBeans in the MBean server
    - Creates, accesses and removes relation types
    - Creates, accesses and removes relations
    - Performs queries on relations

 * SimpleRelation.java:

    - A simple relation MBean class, to be used to create relation MBeans,
      first registered in the MBean server as MBeans, then added to the
      Relation Service as relations

 * SimpleRelationMBean.java:

    - The management interface of the SimpleRelationMBean class

 * SimpleRelationType.java:

    - A simple relation type class, used to create a relation type to be added
      to the Relation Service. This is an alternative to creating a relation
      type describing it each time, because here an instance does it.

 * SimpleStandard.java:

    - A standard MBean, to be used in relations

 * SimpleStandardMBean.java:

    - The management interface of the SimpleStandard class


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

    java RelationAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The RelationAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
