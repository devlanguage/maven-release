                         Open MBean Example
                         ==================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement an open MBean and manage it
through a simple JMX agent application, by:

 - Developing a sample open MBean that uses some of the open data types
   and correctly exposes its management interface at runtime through
   the OpenMBean*Info classes.

 - Developing a simple JMX agent for exercising the open MBean:
    . Initializing the MBean server
    . Creating and adding the sample open MBean to the MBean server
    . Getting and displaying the open MBean management information
    . Invoking some operations on the MBean


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * SampleOpenMBean.java:

    - An open MBean

 * OpenAgent.java:

    - Simple JMX agent for exercising the open MBean


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

    java OpenAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The OpenAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
