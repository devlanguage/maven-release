----- Microsoft Windows 2000 Active Directory -----
---------------------------------------------------

-----------------------
Step-by-Step Guidelines
-----------------------

1/ Install Windows 2000 Advanced Server Edition

2/ Log in as Administrator

3/ Using the Administration Tools (Active Directory Users and Computers) add
   yourself as Schema Administrator

4/ Modify the registry to allow schema updates

   To enable any schema modifications the following registry
   property must be created and set to (DWORD) 1:

       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
         System
           CurrentControlSet
             Services
               NTDS
                 Parameters
                   Schema Update Allowed

5/ Import the Java and JMX LDAP schemas into Active Directory

   Active Directory manages its schema by using an internal format. To update
   the schema, you can use either the Active Directory Management Console
   snap-in, ADSIEdit, the command-line utility LDIFDE or the CreateJavaSchema
   and CreateJmxSchema utilities, following the instructions for Active
   Directory.

   Due to the way auxiliary classes are supported the Active Directory. Only
   the names of structural classes (not auxiliary) may appear in the object
   class attribute of an entry. Therefore, the abstract and auxiliary classes
   in the Java and JMX schema definitions are re-defined as structural.

   If the directory's administration tool supports turning off schema
   checking then do so before running the CreateJavaSchema or
   CreateJmxSchema programs.

   When you run these programs, you need to login as the directory
   administrator, quoting the "-n" option if there are blanks in the
   distinguished name. After updating the schema, you should use the
   directory server's administration tool to verify that the changes
   have been properly applied. If the schema has not been properly
   updated, use the administration tool to correct it.

   NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Active Directory you need to use
         the "-sad" option to workaround schema bugs in the server.

6/ Using the Administration Tools (Active Directory Users and Computers) add
   a new organizational unit (ou=Test) under your domain and take this into
   account when specifying the LDAP suffix to be used by the Lookup examples.

7/ Run the JMX Remote API Lookup examples following the instructions on each
   example's README file.

Windows Active Directory Limitation: Context.rebind() (in the API reference
documentation) and DirContext.rebind() (in the API reference documentation)
do not work against Active Directory because these methods work by reading
the attributes of the entry to be updated, removing the entry, and then adding
a new entry that contains the modified attributes. Active Directory returns
some attributes that cannot be set by the user, causing the final addition step
to fail. The workaround for this problem is to use DirContext.getAttributes()
(in the API reference documentation) to obtain and save the attributes that you
want to keep. Then, remove the entry and add it back with the saved attributes
(and any others that you want to add) using DirContext.bind() (in the API
reference documentation).

This limitation means that after running any example using the JNDI LDAP URL
the cn=x,ou=Test,<dc=...> LDAP entry will have to be removed manually as the
Server examples do not call unbind as they are terminated with a Control+C.
