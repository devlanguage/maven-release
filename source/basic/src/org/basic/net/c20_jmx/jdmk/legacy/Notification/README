                         Notification Example
                         ====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to use Java DMK notification service. The communication
between the agent and the client is done via an RMI connector.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source file:

 * BaseAgent.java:

        - It is same as the BaseAgent example.

 * Client.java

        - It is used to show how to configure the Java DMK notification
          service, and how to receive notifications from a remote MBean.

 * NotificationEmitter.java

        - An MBean that emits notifications.

 * NotificationEmitterMBean.java:

        - The management interface of the NotificationEmitter MBean.

3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the jar files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar) and the Java DMK runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current
directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the jar files for the Java DMK
runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the agent, type:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    java BaseAgent

To run the client, type in another shell window:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    java Client <agent_hostname>

The <agent_hostname> indicates at which machine the agent is running. If no
agent hostname is specified, 'localhost' is used by default.
