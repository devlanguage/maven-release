                          MLet Service Example
                          ====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a simple agent application that uses
the MLet service defined in the JMX specification.

The agent in this example registers an MLet MBean which is used to load
new MBeans, not accessible through the CLASSPATH, into the agent and
register them with the MBean server.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * MLetAgent.java:

    - Creates an MBean server
    - Registers an MLet MBean in the MBean server
    - Invokes the addURL method of the MLet MBean to specify the URL
      pointing to the Square.jar file
    - Creates and registers a Square MBean with the MLet classloader
      that loaded the Square MBean classes
    - Invokes the getMBeansFromURL method of the MLet MBean to create
      and register new EquilateralTriangle MBeans by means of an HTML
      document containing MLET tags
    - Creates and registers an EquilateralTriangle MBean with the MLet
      classloader that loaded the EquilateralTriangle MBean classes

 * Square.java:

    - A standard MBean representing a square

 * SquareMBean.java:

    - The management interface of the Square MBean

 * EquilateralTriangle.java:

    - A standard MBean representing an equilateral triangle

 * EquilateralTriangleMBean.java:

    - The management interface of the EquilateralTriangle MBean

 * GeometricShapes.html:

    - An HTML document containing the MLET tags that are used
      by the MLet MBean to load and register the new MBeans.

3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

    jar cf Square.jar Square.class SquareMBean.class

    rm Square.class SquareMBean.class

    jar cf EquilateralTriangle.jar EquilateralTriangle.class EquilateralTriangleMBean.class

    rm EquilateralTriangle.class EquilateralTriangleMBean.class

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

    java MLetAgent file:/<WORKING_DIR>/Square.jar file:/<WORKING_DIR>/GeometricShapes.html

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The MLetAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
