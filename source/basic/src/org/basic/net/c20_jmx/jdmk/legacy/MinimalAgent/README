                       Minimal Agent Example
                       =====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a very simple minimal agent that can
be accessed through a Web browser pointed to the HTML protocol adaptor.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source file:

 * MinimalAgent.java:

    - Creates an MBean server
    - Creates, registers and starts an HTML protocol adaptor, an HTTP
      connector server and an RMI connector server in the MBean server


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the jar files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar) and the Java DMK runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current
directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the jar files for the Java DMK
runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the following
command:

    java MinimalAgent

This Java DMK agent is now running on your machine. To manage the agent through
a Web browser, load the following URL: http://localhost:8082/

You may also access this agent from any remote machine on the same network by
connecting to this URL: http://<agentHostName>:8082/ (where <agentHostName> is
the name or IP address of the machine where you launched the MinimalAgent).

Please refer to the tutorial provided in this software bundle for further
instructions about interacting with the Java DMK agent through the HTML
protocol adaptor.
