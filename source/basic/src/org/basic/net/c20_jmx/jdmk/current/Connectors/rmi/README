# 
#  Example of a basic RMI connector
# 
# ==============================================================================
#
# In order to compile & run the example, make a copy of this
# README file, update the variables to match your local installation,
# and then simply cut & paste all variable definitions & commands 
# as needed into a terminal window.
#
# Note that this README makes the assumption that you are running
# UNIX, you are familiar with the JMX Remote API specification (in
# particular JMXServiceURL), and with Bourne or Korn shell syntax.
#
# All variable assignments and commands below are defined using 
# UNIX korn shell syntax.
#
# If you are not running UNIX and the Korn shell you are expected
# to be able to adapt these commands to your favorite OS/shell
# environment.
#

# Update the following variables to match your local installation:
#
JDMK_HOME=@INSTALL_HOME_FOR_JDMK@
JDMK_LIB=${JDMK_HOME}/lib

classp=${JDMK_LIB}/jmx.jar:${JDMK_LIB}/jmxremote.jar:.

# JMX and JMX Remote API (mandatory) are integrated into J2SE 1.5 so
#
# classp=.

# Compile the Java classes
#
# * Server.java: creates an MBeanServer and creates and starts an RMI connector
#                server (JRMP).
#
# * Client.java: creates an RMI connector (JRMP), creates and registers a Simple
#                standard MBean and performs operations on it.
#
# * ClientListener.java: implements a generic notification listener.
#
# * SimpleStandard.java: implements the Simple standard MBean.
#
# * SimpleStandardMBean.java: the management interface exposed by the Simple
#                             standard MBean.
#

javac -classpath $classp *.java

# Start the RMI registry:
#

export CLASSPATH=$classp ; rmiregistry 9999 &

# Start the Server:
#

java -classpath $classp Server &

# Start the Client:
#

java -classpath $classp Client
