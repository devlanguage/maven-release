                         Standard MBean Example
                         ======================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to write a standard MBean and manage it through
a simple Java DMK agent application:

 - Develop a standard MBean that complies with the design patterns of
   the JMX instrumentation level

 - Develop a simple Java DMK agent for exercising the MBean:
    . Initialize the MBean server
    . Create and register the MBean in the MBean server
    . Get and set attributes, invoke operations on the MBean
      using standard proxies
    . Try to invoke MBean methods not exposed for management


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses the following source files:

 * SimpleStandard.java:

    - A standard MBean

 * SimpleStandardMBean.java:

    - The management interface of the SimpleStandard class

 * StandardAgent.java:

    - Creates an MBean server
    - Registers a standard MBean in the MBean server
    - Gets information on the management interface of the MBean
    - Invokes MBean methods exposed for management with success
      and tries to invoke methods not exposed for management
      without success


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

    java StandardAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The StandardAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
