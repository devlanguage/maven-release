                         Model MBean Example
                         ===================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a simple JMX agent application that
uses the Model MBean defined in the JMX specification.

The agent in this example shows the use of a Model MBean to manage an
application Java Bean, named "TestBean". It also demonstrates how to
have attributes in the same Model MBean supported by methods on different
objects.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * ModelAgent.java:

    - Creates an MBean server.
    - Registers a Model MBean in the MBean server.
    - Configures the Model MBean in order to manage two simple application
      Java Beans called "TestBean" and "TestBeanFriend".
    - It registers an object of class "TestBeanAttributeChangeListener" as
      a listener to all the notifications emitted when the attribute "State"
      of the "TestBean" changes.
    - It performs management operations on the application Java Beans using
      the Model MBean.

 * TestBeanAttributeChangeListener.java:

    - Implements the javax.management.NotificationListener interface.
      It receives the attribute change notifications emitted by the
      Model MBean when the attribute "State" of the "TestBean" changes.

 * TestBean.java:

    - Simple definition of a Java Bean which is managed by a Model MBean.

 * TestBeanFriend.java:

    - Simple definition of a Java Bean which is managed by a Model MBean.
      It implements the same methods as "TestBean". It is used by the
      ModelAgent test program to illustrate and demonstrate how to have
      attributes in the same ModelMBean supported by methods on different
      objects.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

    java ModelAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The ModelAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
