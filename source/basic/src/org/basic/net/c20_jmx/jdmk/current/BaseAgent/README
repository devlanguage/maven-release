                         Base Agent Example
                         ==================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a simple agent application that can
be accessed through a Web browser, that points to the HTML protocol 
adaptor instantiated by this agent.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source file:

 * BaseAgent.java:

    - Creates an MBean server,
    - Gets the MBean server ID from the MBean server delegate,
    - Creates, registers and starts an HTML protocol adaptor in the
      MBean server using a first method (where creation and
      registration are two separate steps: the agent creates the adaptor
      and then registers it in the MBean server).

Note: In this example code, when no object name for a protocol adaptor
      is provided to the MBean server, the protocol adaptor is itself able 
      to provide a default object name to the MBean server, as a
      result of the preRegister method of the protocol adaptor.
      This method is specified by the MBeanRegistration interface.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar) and the Java DMK runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current
directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the Java DMK
runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it can also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

    java BaseAgent

This Java DMK agent is now running on your machine. To manage the agent
through a Web browser, load the following URL: http://localhost:8082/

You can also access this agent from any remote machine on the same
network by connecting to this URL: http://<agentHostName>:8082/
(where <agentHostName> is the name or IP address of the machine
where you launched the BaseAgent).

Please refer to the Tutorial provided in this software bundle for further
instructions about interacting with the Java DMK agent through the HTML
protocol adaptor.
