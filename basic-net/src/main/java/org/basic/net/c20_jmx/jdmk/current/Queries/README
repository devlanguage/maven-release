                        Query Example
                        =============


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this example is to illustrate how query expressions 
are used as filters, and enable you to retrieve MBeans from within
an MBean server, according to their attribute values.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

   * QueryAgent.java:

        - Implements a simple agent application.
        - Creates ClassMB MBeans in the MBean server.
        - Applies queries to the MBeans registered in the agent
          to select those that match certain selection criteria.

   * Queries.java

        - Defines the set of query expressions that are applied by
          the QueryAgent.

   * ClassMB.java:

        - Implements a simple MBean which represents a java class.
        - Registers all its methods as MethodMB MBeans in the 
          MBean server.

   * ClassMBMBean.java:

        - The management interface for ClassMB MBean.

   * MethodMB.java:

        - Implements a simple MBean.
        - Represents the methods of a Java class.

   * MethodMBMBean.java:

        - The management interface for MethodMB MBean


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar) and the Java DMK runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current
directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the Java DMK
runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the following
commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

    java QueryAgent

Please refer to the tutorial provided in this software bundle for
more details.
