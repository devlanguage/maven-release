                         Open MBean Example 2
                         ====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement an open MBean and manage it through
a simple JMX Remote API manager application, by:

 - Developing a sample open MBean that uses some of the open data types
   and correctly exposing its management interface at runtime through
   the OpenMBean*Info classes.

 - Developing a simple manager for exercising the open MBean:
    . Creating and adding the sample open MBean to the MBean server
    . Getting and displaying the open MBean management information
    . Invoking some operations on the MBean


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * CarOpenMBean.java:

    - An open MBean.

 * Agent.java:

    - A Java DMK agent (MBean server, HTML adaptor and JMXMP connector).

 * Manager.java:

    - Client application which runs the example scenario.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH environment variable
is correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4 or later.

On J2SE 1.4, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the JMX runtime
(jmx.jar), JMX Remote API runtime (jmxremote.jar and jmxremote_optional.jar)
and Java DMK runtime (jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

On J2SE 1.5, your CLASSPATH must contain the JAR files for the optional part of
the JMX Remote API runtime (jmxremote_optional.jar) and the Java DMK runtime
(jdmkrt.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment variable,
though it may also be given on the command line with the -classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your working directory and type the
following commands:

    cd <WORKING_DIR>

    javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, first run
the agent:

    java Agent

Open another terminal window on the same machine where the agent is running,
move into the OpenMBean2 example directory and run the manager:

    java Manager

You then interact with the manager through the standard input and output in the
window where it was launched. The Manager class displays information about each
management step and waits for user input before continuing.
